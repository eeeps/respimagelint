## ðŸš¨ eeepsâ€™ fork ðŸš¨

The real, official, supported project lives here: [github.com/ausi/respimagelint](https://github.com/ausi/respimagelint).

I made this little fork in order to resize tested viewports *one* `px` at a time (the original bookmarklet resizes in `20px` steps). This makes the `sizes` that the tool suggests slightly more accurate, at the cost of making the bookmarklet 20Ã— slower.
