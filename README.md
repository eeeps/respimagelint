## ðŸš¨ eeepsâ€™ fork ðŸš¨

The real, official (supported!) project lives here: [github.com/ausi/respimagelint](https://github.com/ausi/respimagelint)

But you can install this forked (unsupported!) bookmarklet by going *here*: [eeeps.github.io/respimagelint](https://eeeps.github.io/respimagelint)

I forked the original in order to resize tested viewports *one* `px` at a time (the original bookmarklet resizes in `20px` steps). This makes the `sizes` that the tool suggests slightly more accurate, at the cost of making the bookmarklet 20Ã— slower.
